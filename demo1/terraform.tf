# PROVIDERS #
#############

# A provider usually needs credentials. Here, we use the DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN
# environment variable which is automatically sourced by Terraform.  Also, the
# version can be (and should be) pinned with Terraform v0.10 and above. If you
# remove that option from the provider block and run 'terraform init', this is
# what Terraform will suggest.

provider "digitalocean" {
  version = "~> 0.1"
}

#############
# VARIABLES #
#############

# The location of my public key for DO Droplets. It has a default value that
# can be overwritten in terraform.tfvars or at the CLI if necessary.

variable "ssh_key"  { default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa_do.pub" }

# We also declare a variable for the Droplet size. Its value is set in
# terraform.tfvars but again, we can overwrite it at the CLI (try to add '-var
# droplet_size="1gb"' to the terraform plan command).

variable "droplet_size"  { }

# RESOURCES #
#############

# Some options are required, others are optional (see the provider's docs). The
# value for the 'ssh_keys' variable is the 'fingerprint' output of the
# 'digitalocean_ssh_key' resource.
